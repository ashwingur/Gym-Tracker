# Gym-Tracker
Gym tracking android app
This gym tracker application allows you to log any exercises you have done, allowing you to enter the Exercise Name, weight, sets and reps. The date is automatically logged.
You can then view these in the View Progress Page to see how you have progressed over time. In this page you can also sort the exercises by date, weight and reps.
